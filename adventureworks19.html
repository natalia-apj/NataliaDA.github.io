            PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br />
            The project was focused on investigating and analysing data in
            AdventureWorks 2019 sample dataset, and providing answers to
            clientsâ€™ (Generation UK&I) questions. The dataset, set as an training
            environment for team work, contains vast information from following departments:
            HR (customers and employees), Production, Sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            METHODS: <br />
            The data was collected on SQL SSMS and sorted with SQL queries to
            withdraw only the data wanted from the wide range of tables.
            Database schema, table structure and entity-relationship model were
            extracted from SQL SSMS and allowed to understand and plan
            subsequent steps. Visual Studio Code was used to run python codes
            for analysis of the csv files generated from SQL queries and python
            statistical analysis to visually represent the data. To interpret
            the relationship between the different variables in the applicable
            questions regression lines on some scatter plots, trendlines, and
            correlation coefficients were implemented. Data were plotted with
            Matplotlib to allow clear interpretation.
          </p>
          <p>
            FINDINGS: <br />
            1. Total sales for best performing country (USA) are 4-times higher
            than the next best performing one (Canada) with Southwest region
            taking a lead. <br />
            2. Employees who took more hours of holiday/annual leave received
            higher bonuses. The higher the level of position within the
            organization the lower the number of sick leave. <br />
            3. Shops with shorter market histories earn relatively more than
            well-established shops already present on the market. <br />
            4. There is a global trend across countries in North America and
            Europe, seen as strong positive correlation between number of
            employees, store size, and revenue.
          </p>
          <p>
            CONCLUSIONS: <br />To keep sales and revenue at current levels
            company need to consider following factors: <br />
            - adjust business development and expected revenue to economic
            strength of customers' country,<br />
            - work performance among employees - more holidays translates to
            more efficient work, <br />
            - balance the number of high and low-level job employees for
            efficient work performance and sick leave absence predictions,
            <br />
            - shops present longer on the market need to be revised in the
            context of potential stagnation in development, introducing modern
            technology or more effective marketing strategies.
