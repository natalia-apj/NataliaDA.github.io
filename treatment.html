            PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br />
            The project was focused on implementing the knowledge and skills acquired during 8 week Kickstarter course lead by CodeFirstGirls. The aim of the project was to create, deliver and present a brand new, functinonal database in MySQL which had to fulfill training objectives and include elements such as: ER Diagram, set keys, tables, queries, procedure and trigger <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18SnaDKsjFJ2gV1YaMSReShufCGvYXdYc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107685767470450872906&rtpof=true&sd=true"
            >(view the document)</a>. Created database contained real cancer treatment data with fictitious patients. Visualisations were added later. 
          </p>
          <p>
            METHODS: <br />
            Information about medication and active substances, illnesses identification codes and names, treatment programme details, hospitals' data were downloaded from Polish National Health Service (NFZ). The data were formatted and customised and customised for project needs. The patients were fictitious and their medical condition, illness code, therapy and hospital were genrated randomly from prepared lists. 
          </p>
          <p>
            FINDINGS (after adding visualisations): <br />
            1. Two thirds of the patients treated in the period of a year are patients continuing therapy. <br />
            2. Hospitals are specialised in treatment of patients with particular illnesses. <br />
            3. Some programmes use only one medication while in others patients can be treated with choice of medications. <br/>
            4. Pharmaceutical companies have different levels in cost participation for different medications.<br/>
            5. The patients' age distribution is bimodal with most patients with two peaks, 45 and 65 years of age.
          </p>
          <p>
            CONCLUSIONS: <br />Treatment continuation is a prority within existing funding. <br />
            There is a variety of options of medications used in some treatments. Some of the treatment options could be revised to give acces for wider options variety.<br />
            There should be a tendency towards increasing Risk Sharing agreements to reduce treatment options which allows to treat bigger number of patients. <br />
            Observed ilness prevalence is observed mostly in tho age groups, 45 and 65 year olds.
