              PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br />
              The project was focused on analysing Brazilian Olist Store public
              dataset containing information of 100 000 orders from 2016 to
              2018. Olist Store functions as marketplace platform facilitating
              trade between small retailers and customers and provides
              logistics. The dataset contains real wholesale data with order
              details, order status, price, shipping, payment methods as well as
              customer location, product characteristics and customer reviews.
              Information about business partners as well as customer data have
              been anonymized.
            </p>
            <p>
              METHODS: <br />
              This analysis examines company’s four main areas: revenue and
              financial trends over 18 months, number of customers and sellers,
              product categories and order processing details, customer
              satisfaction. Data preparation, analysis and visualisations were
              prepared mainly in PowerBI.
            </p>
            <p>
              FINDINGS: <br />
              1. Company’s revenue rise is driven mainly by new customers as
              there is low customer retention rate. <br />
              2. There is a slight decrease in customer and order numbers in the
              2nd half of 2018. <br />
              3. Customers rarely buy more than 1 item and some products are
              preferred more than others. <br />
              4. Positive customer reviews are prevalent in closer locations and
              correlate with shorter delivery times. Moreover, customer
              preferences for providing feedback are mostly bimodal and the
              number of negative reviews is not even across product categories.
            </p>
            <p>
              CONCLUSIONS: <br />Olist Store could improve customer retention
              rate and encourage customers to buy more than 1 product to reduce
              shipping costs/product per client. <br />Expanding to more distant
              markets could be difficult without significant improvement of
              order delivery times.<br />
              Over-reliance on products more dominant in sales could be risky if
              market trends shift.
